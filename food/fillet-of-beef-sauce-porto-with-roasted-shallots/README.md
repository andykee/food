* 6 peeled whole shallots plus 1 peeled, thinly sliced shallot
* 4 tbsp butter
* 2 8-ounce beef filets

* 1 tsp flour
* 3 ounces port
* 1 cup beef or veal stock
* 1 spoonful beef or veal demi-glace

## Prep
Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F. Peel shallots. Slice one. Do not pre-salt fillets - they will be too salty.

## Cook
Place the peeled whole shallots and 1 tbsp butter in a small ovenproof saute pan, cover with foil, and put in the oven. Cook low and slow, gently turning the shallots every once in a while, until they are brown and soft and slightly limp, but still recognizable and intact - about 45 mintes to an hour. Remove and keep warm.

While the shallots roast, heat large saute pan over medium heat. Melt 1 tbsp butter and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 4 minutes, sprinkle in the flour, and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the port and deglaze, scraping with a wooden spoon. Reduce by half, then add the stock and demi-glace, bring to a boil, and reduce by half again, until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning and strain through a fine strainer into a small saucepan. Bring the sauce back to a boil, bring back to a boilm remove from the heat, and whisk in the remaining tablespoon of butter.

Increase the oven temp to 375&deg;F. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add 1 tbsp of butter, let it foam, and allow it to subside. Sear the meat on all sides, using the tongs to turn the fillets. Make sure the sides are seared too. Transfer the meat to a roasting pan and place in the oven. Roast unti the meat is 135&deg;F, about 15 minutes for medium rare.

## Serve
Remove the fillets from the oven, rest them a few moments, and arrange on a plate. Artfullt estle 3 of the cooked whole shallots next to each fillet and spoon over the sauce. Good with mashed potatoes or a simple salad.
