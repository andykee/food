## Ingredients
6 Tbsp water
1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil, extra-virgin
2 1/4 tsp lemon zest
4 1/2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp table salt, or to taste
3/4 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
1 pound uncooked boneless skinless chicken breasts, four 4-oz pieces
2 sprays cooking spray
4 cups, shredded romaine lettuce, thickly shredded
1 cup canned drained chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup roasted red peppers (packed in water), diced
1 cup English cucumber, sliced
8 medium olive, Kalamata, sliced
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
4 1/2 Tbsp dill, fresh, chopped
1/2 medium lemon, cut into wedges for garnish

# Instructions
In a small bowl, combine water, oil, lemon zest and juice, garlic, salt and pepper; remove 1/4 cup of dressing and place in a large zip-close plastic bag (or glass bowl).

Add chicken to bag (or bowl) and turn to coat; seal bag (or cover bowl) and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining lemon mixture for dressing.

When ready to cook, off heat, coat grill or grill pan with cooking spray; preheat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade.

Grill chicken, turning as needed, until cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Place lettuce on a serving platter; arrange vegetables, chickpeas, chicken, olives and cheese on top. Stir dill into reserved dressing; drizzle over salad. Yields about 1 1/2 cups salad, 1 chicken breast and 1 tablespoon each olives and feta per serving.
